# CourseFilesAuditor
This tool is similar to Grant's tool; it is meant to search a course to discover where there are any problems, if there are any.

I have conferred with a co-worker, and we have decided that we will have the information push onto firebase, instead of creating a CSV file.  This has obvious implications; it means that the code will be rewritten to accomodate for that.  Furthermore, future branches will be pushed onto Andrew Gremlich's GitHub repository.  Link will be provided when my first push is made.
